# INSTACART SALESâ€”PYTHON PROJECT
## INTRODUCTION
Instacart, a leading online grocery store operating through a user-friendly app, has revolutionized the way people shop for groceries. With its seamless interface and convenient delivery options, Instacart has experienced tremendous success, catering to a wide range of customers' needs. While Instacart enjoys commendable sales figures, the company is keen to gain a deeper understanding of their customers and their purchasing behaviors. Recognizing that a one-size-fits-all marketing approach is no longer sufficient, Instacart's stakeholders are interested in implementing a targeted marketing strategy. 
## OBJECTIVE
Identify unique customer profiles within the existing customer base and propose strategies for improved customer segmentation. These strategies will enable the customization of marketing campaigns to effectively target each segment.
